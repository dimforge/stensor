----

The goal of **gla** is to especially be "[**nalgebra**](https://nalgebra.rs) on the
gpu". It aims (but it isn’t there yet) to expose linear algebra operations (including BLAS-like and LAPACK-like
operations) as well as geometric types (quaternions, similarities, etc.) as composable Slang shaders and kernels.
